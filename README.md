# Presenter

This is a simple tool I wrote in approximately 15 minutes to help build a presentation for AP
Microeconomics. The slides are videos generated by [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), and the
site hosts them and allows the user to switch between them with the arrow keys.

It also plays some [cool background music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT6XaOrZhsA) when you
press space. The up and down arrows control the volume.

The site prefetches all of the clips upon first load for a smooth experience. This works well on
fast and reliable networks, not so much on crappy ones (as I unfortunately found out on the day of
the presentation).

Lesson learned: I probably should've just used
[Manim Slides](https://www.manim.community/plugin/manim-slides/).

## Demo

You can view a demo at [this link](https://econ.youwen.dev/). Try pressing the arrow keys!

Alternatively, host a local version by cloning the repository, then ensure you have `pnpm` and
nodejs installed, and run:

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm build`
3. `pnpm preview`

This hosts the site locally at `localhost:4173`.
